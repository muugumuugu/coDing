<p>In <a href="First-class functions">First-class functions</a>, a language is showing how its manipulation of functions is similar to its manipulation of other types.<code></code>
<code></code>
This tasks aim is to compare and contrast a language's implementation of first class functions, with its normal handling of numbers.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
Write a program to create an ordered collection of a mixture of literally typed and expressions producing a real number, together with another ordered collection of their multiplicative inverses. Try and use the following pseudo-code to generate the numbers for the ordered collections:<code></code>
   x  = 2.0<code></code>
   xi = 0.5<code></code>
   y  = 4.0<code></code>
   yi = 0.25<code></code>
   z  = x + y<code></code>
   zi = 1.0 / ( x + y )<code></code>
<code></code>
Create a function <code>multiplier</code>, that given two numbers as arguments returns a function that when called with one argument, returns the result of multiplying the two arguments to the call to multiplier that created it and the argument in the call:<code></code>
  new<em>function = multiplier(n1,n2)<code></code>
  # where new</em>function(m) returns the result of n1 * n2 * m<code></code>
<code></code>
Applying the multiplier of a number and its inverse from the two ordered collections of numbers in pairs, show that the result in each case is one.<br><code></code>
<code>Compare and contrast the resultant program with the corresponding entry in <a href="First-class functions">First-class functions</a>.</code> They should be close.<code></code>

<small>To paraphrase the task description: Do what was done before, but with numbers rather than functions</small><code></code>
