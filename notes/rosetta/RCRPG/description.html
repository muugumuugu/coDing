<p>Create a simple interactive game which incorporates the following features:<code></code>
<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>room-based navigation in three integer dimensions (x,y,z)<code></code></li>
<li>player inventory<code></code></li>
<li>three types of item: sledge, gold and ladder<code></code></li>
<li>a goal coordinate<code></code>
<code></code>
Use of the sledge should be required to create a passage between rooms.  The ladder should be present in a room (but not held by the player), in order for the player to access the room above him.  The gold need not have a function.<code></code>
