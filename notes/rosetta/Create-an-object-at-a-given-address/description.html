In systems programing it is sometimes required to place language objects at specific memory locations, like I/O registers, hardware interrupt vectors etc.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Task:<code></code>
Show how language objects can be allocated at a specific machine addresses.<code></code>
<code></code>
Since most <a href="OS]]es prohibit access to the physical memory if it is not mapped by the application, as an example, rather than a physical address, take the address of some existing object (using suitable <a href="[Address Operations|address operations">OS]">[Address Operations|address operations">OS]</a>es prohibit access to the physical memory if it is not mapped by the application, as an example, rather than a physical address, take the address of some existing object (using suitable [[Address Operations|address operations</a> if necessary).<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
For example:<code></code>
::* &nbsp; create an integer object<code></code>
::* &nbsp; print the machine address of the object<code></code>
::* &nbsp; take the address of the object and create another integer object at this address<code></code>
::* &nbsp; print the value of this object to verify that it is same as one of the origin<code></code>
::* &nbsp; change the value of the origin and verify it again<code></code>
