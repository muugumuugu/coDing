<p><a href="wp:Josephus problem|Josephus problem">wp:Josephus problem|Josephus problem</a> is a math puzzle with a grim description: <math>n</math> prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered from <math>0</math> to <math>n-1</math>.<code></code>
<code></code>
An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner <math>0</math><br><code></code>
removing every <math>k</math>-th prisoner and killing him.<code></code>
<code></code>
As the process goes on, the circle becomes smaller and smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is then freed. &gt;<code></code>
<code></code>
For example, if there are <math>n=5</math> prisoners and <math>k=2</math>, the order the prisoners are killed in (let's call it the "killing sequence") will be 1, 3, 0, and 4, and the survivor will be #2.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Task:<code></code>
Given any &nbsp; <big><math>n, k > 0</math></big>, &nbsp; find out which prisoner will be the final survivor.<code></code>
<code></code>
In one such incident, there were 41 prisoners and every 3<sup>rd</sup> prisoner was being killed &nbsp; (<big><math>k=3</math></big>).<code></code>
<code></code>
Among them was a clever chap name Josephus who worked out the problem, stood at the surviving position, and lived on to tell the tale.<code></code>
<code></code>
Which number was he?<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Extra:<code></code>
The captors may be especially kind and let <math>m</math> survivors free<br><code></code>
<br>and Josephus might just have &nbsp; <big><math>m-1</math></big> &nbsp; friends to save.<code></code>
<code></code>
Provide a way to calculate which prisoner is at any given position on the killing sequence.<code></code>
