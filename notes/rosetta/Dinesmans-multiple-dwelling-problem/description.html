<code></code>
Solutions are allowed (but not required) to parse and interpret the problem text, but should remain flexible and should state what changes to the problem text are allowed. Flexibility and ease of expression are valued.<code></code>
<code></code>
Examples may be be split into "setup", "problem statement", and "output" sections where the ease and naturalness of stating the problem and getting an answer, as well as the ease and flexibility of modifying the problem are the primary concerns.<code></code>
<code></code>
Example output should be shown here, as well as any comments on the examples flexibility.<code></code>
