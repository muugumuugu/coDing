The task is to demonstrate how to compare two strings from within the language and how to achieve a lexical comparison.<code></code>
<code></code>
The task should demonstrate:<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>Comparing two strings for exact equality<code></code></li>
<li>Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)<code></code></li>
<li>Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other<code></code></li>
<li>Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other<code></code></li>
<li>How to achieve both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language<code></code></li>
<li>How the language handles comparison of numeric strings if these are not treated lexically<code></code></li>
<li>Demonstrate any other kinds of string comparisons that the language provides, particularly as it relates to your type system. &nbsp; For example, you might demonstrate the difference between generic/polymorphic comparison and coercive/allomorphic comparison if your language supports such a distinction.<code></code>
<code></code>
<br><code></code>
Here "generic/polymorphic" comparison means that the function or operator you're using doesn't always do string comparison, but bends the actual semantics of the comparison depending on the types one or both arguments; with such an operator, you achieve string comparison only if the arguments are sufficiently string-like in type or appearance.<code></code>
<code></code>
In contrast, a "coercive/allomorphic" comparison function or operator has fixed string-comparison semantics regardless of the argument type; &nbsp; instead of the operator bending, it's the arguments that are forced to bend instead and behave like strings if they can, &nbsp; and the operator simply fails if the arguments cannot be viewed somehow as strings. &nbsp; A language may have one or both of these kinds of operators; &nbsp; see the Perl&nbsp;6 entry for an example of a language with both kinds of operators.<code></code>
