Many structured languages restrict their [[conditional structures]</a> and [[loops</a> to <code>local jumps</code> within a function. Some assembly languages limit certain jumps or branches to a small range.<code></code>
<code></code>
This task is demonstrate a local jump and a global jump and the various other types of jumps that the language supports.<code></code>
For the purpose of this task, the jumps need not be used for a single purpose and you have the freedom to use these jumps for different purposes.<code></code>
You may also defer to more specific tasks, like <a href="Exceptions]] or <a href="[Generator">Exceptions]">[Generator">Exceptions]</a> or [[Generator</a>.<code></code>
This task provides a "grab bag" for several types of jumps. There are <code>non-local jumps across function calls, or long jumps</code> to anywhere within a program. Anywhere means not only to the tops of functions!<code></code>
<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>Some languages can <code>go to</code> any global label in a program.<code></code></li>
<li>Some languages can break multiple function calls, also known as <code>unwinding the call stack</code>.<code></code></li>
<li>Some languages can save a <code>continuation</code>. The program can later continue from the same place. So you can jump anywhere, but only if you have a previous visit there (to save the continuation).<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>These jumps are not all alike.<code></code>
A simple <code>goto</code> never touches the call stack.<code></code>
A continuation saves the call stack, so you can continue a function call after it ends.<code></code>

<br>Task:<code></code>
Use your language to demonstrate the various types of jumps that it supports.<code></code>

Because the possibilities vary by language, this task is not specific.<code></code>
