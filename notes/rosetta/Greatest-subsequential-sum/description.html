Given a sequence of integers, find a continuous subsequence which maximizes the sum of its elements, that is, the elements of no other single subsequence add up to a value larger than this one.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
An empty subsequence is considered to have the sum of &nbsp; <code>0</code>; &nbsp; thus if all elements are negative, the result must be the empty sequence.<code></code>
