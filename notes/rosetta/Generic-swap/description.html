<p><br>Task:<code></code>
Write a generic swap function or operator which exchanges the values of two variables (or, more generally, any two storage places that can be assigned), regardless of their types.<code></code>
<code></code>
If your solution language is statically typed please describe the way your language provides genericity.<code></code>
<code></code>
If variables are typed in the given language, it is permissible that the two variables be constrained to having a mutually compatible type, such that each is permitted to hold the value previously stored in the other without a type violation.<code></code>
That is to say, solutions do not have to be capable of exchanging, say, a string and integer value, if the underlying storage locations are not attributed with types that permit such an exchange.<code></code>
<code></code>
Generic swap is a task which brings together a few separate issues in programming language semantics.<code></code>
<code></code>
Dynamically typed languages deal with values in a generic way quite readily, but do not necessarily make it easy to write a function to destructively swap two variables, because this requires indirection upon storage places or upon the syntax designating storage places.<code></code>
<code></code>
Functional languages, whether static or dynamic, do not necessarily allow a destructive operation such as swapping two variables regardless of their generic capabilities.<code></code>
<code></code>
Some static languages have difficulties with generic programming due to a lack of support for (<a href="Parametric Polymorphism">Parametric Polymorphism</a>).<code></code>

Do your best!<code></code>
