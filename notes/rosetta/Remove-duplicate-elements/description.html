<p>Given an Array, derive a sequence of elements in which all duplicates are removed.<code></code>
<code></code>
There are basically three approaches seen here:<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>Put the elements into a hash table which does not allow duplicates. The complexity is O(<code>n) on average, and O(n</code><sup>2</sup>) worst case. This approach requires a hash function for your type (which is compatible with equality), either built-in to your language, or provided by the user.<code></code></li>
<li>Sort the elements and remove consecutive duplicate elements. The complexity of the best sorting algorithms is O(<code>n log n</code>). This approach requires that your type be "comparable", i.e., have an ordering. Putting the elements into a self-balancing binary search tree is a special case of sorting.<code></code></li>
<li>Go through the list, and for each element, check the rest of the list to see if it appears again, and discard it if it does. The complexity is O(<code>n</code><sup>2</sup>). The up-shot is that this always works on any type (provided that you can test for equality).<code></code>
