Implement the <a href="wp:Hough transform|Hough transform">wp:Hough transform|Hough transform</a>, which is used as part of feature extraction with digital images.<code></code>
<code></code>
It is a tool that makes it far easier to identify straight lines in the source image, whatever their orientation.<code></code>
<code></code>
The transform maps each point in the target image, <math>(\rho,\theta)</math>, to the average color of the pixels on the corresponding line of the source image (in <math>(x,y)</math>-space, where the line corresponds to points of the form <math>x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta = \rho</math>). The idea is that where there is a straight line in the original image, it corresponds to a bright (or dark, depending on the color of the background field) spot; by applying a suitable filter to the results of the transform, it is possible to extract the locations of the lines in the original image.<code></code>

The target space actually uses polar coordinates, but is conventionally plotted on rectangular coordinates for display. There's no specification of exactly how to map polar coordinates to a flat surface for display, but a convenient method is to use one axis for <math>\theta</math> and the other for <math>\rho</math>, with the center of the source image being the origin.<code></code>
<code></code>
There is also a spherical Hough transform, which is more suited to identifying planes in 3D data.<code></code>
