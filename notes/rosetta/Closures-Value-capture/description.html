<p><br>Task:<code></code>
Create a list of ten functions, in the simplest manner possible &nbsp; (anonymous functions are encouraged), &nbsp; such that the function at index&nbsp;&nbsp;<big> <code><b> i </b> </big> &nbsp; (you may choose to start &nbsp; <big> <b> i </b> </big> &nbsp; from either &nbsp; <big> <code>0' </big> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <big> '1</code>), </big>  &nbsp; when run, should return the square of the index, &nbsp; that is, &nbsp; <big> <b> i </b></code> <sup>2</sup>.</big><code></code>
<code></code>
Display the result of running any but the last function, to demonstrate that the function indeed remembers its value.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Goal:<code></code>
Demonstrate how to create a series of independent closures based on the same template but maintain separate copies of the variable closed over.<code></code>
<code></code>
In imperative languages, one would generally use a loop with a mutable counter variable.<code></code>
<code></code>
For each function to maintain the correct number, it has to capture the <code>value</code> of the variable at the time it was created, rather than just a reference to the variable, which would have a different value by the time the function was run.<code></code>
