<p>Most programming languages offer support for <a href="Creating a function|subroutines">Creating a function|subroutines</a>.<code></code>
When execution changes between subroutines, different sets of variables and functions ("scopes") are available to the program.<code></code>
Frequently these sets are defined by the placement of the variable and function declarations ("static scoping" or "lexical scoping").<code></code>
These sets may also be defined by special modifiers to the variable and function declarations.<code></code>
<code></code>
Show the different scope modifiers available in your language and briefly explain how they change the scope of their variable or function.<code></code>
If your language has no scope modifiers, note it.<code></code></p>
