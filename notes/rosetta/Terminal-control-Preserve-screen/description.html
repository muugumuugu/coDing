<br>Task:<code></code>
Clear the screen, output something on the display, and then restore the screen to the preserved state that it was in before the task was carried out.<code></code>
<code></code>
There is no requirement to change the font or kerning in this task, however character decorations and attributes are expected to be preserved. &nbsp; If the implementer decides to change the font or kerning during the display of the temporary screen, then these settings need to be restored prior to exit.<code></code>
