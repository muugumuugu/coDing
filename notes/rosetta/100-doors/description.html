<p>There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.<code></code>

You make 100 <a href="task feature::Rosetta Code:multiple passes|passes">task feature::Rosetta Code:multiple passes|passes</a> by the doors.<code></code>
<code></code>
The first time through, visit every door and &nbsp;<code>toggle</code>&nbsp; the door &nbsp;(if the door is closed, &nbsp;open it; &nbsp; if it is open,&nbsp; close it).<code></code>
<code></code>
The second time, only visit every 2<sup>nd</sup> door &nbsp; (door #2, #4, #6, ...), &nbsp; and toggle it.<code></code>
<code></code>
The third time, visit every 3<sup>rd</sup> door &nbsp; (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, &nbsp; until you only visit the 100<sup>th</sup> door.<code></code>

Opening only those doors is an &nbsp; <a href="task feature::Rosetta Code:optimization|optimization">task feature::Rosetta Code:optimization|optimization</a> &nbsp; that may also be expressed;<code></code>
however, as should be obvious, this defeats the intent of comparing implementations across programming languages.<code></code>
