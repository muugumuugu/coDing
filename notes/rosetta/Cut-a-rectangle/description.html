<p>A given rectangle is made from <code>m × n squares. If m and n</code> are not both odd, then it is possible to cut a path through the rectangle along the square edges such that the rectangle splits into two connected pieces with the same shape (after rotating one of the pieces by 180°). All such paths for 2 × 2 and 4 × 3 rectangles are shown below.<code></code>
