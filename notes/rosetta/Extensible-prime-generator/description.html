<p><br>Task:<code></code>
Write a generator of prime numbers, in order, that will automatically adjust to accommodate the generation of any reasonably high prime.<code></code>
<code></code>
The routine should demonstrably rely on either:<code></code></p>
<h1 id="beingbasedonanopenendedcountersettocountwithoutupperlimitotherthansystemorprogramminglanguagelimitsinthiscaseexplainwherethiscounterisinthecodec4c">Being based on an open-ended counter set to count without upper limit other than system or programming language limits. In this case, explain where this counter is in the code.<code></code></h1>
<h1 id="beingbasedonalimitthatisextendedautomaticallyinthiscasechooseasmalllimitthatensuresthelimitwillbepassedwhengeneratingsomeofthevaluestobeaskedforbelowc5c">Being based on a limit that is extended automatically. In this case, choose a small limit that ensures the limit will be passed when generating some of the values to be asked for below.<code></code></h1>
<h1 id="ifothermethodsofcreatinganextensibleprimegeneratorareusedthealgorithmsmeansofextensibilitylackoflimitsshouldbestatedc6c">If other methods of creating an extensible prime generator are used, the algorithm's means of extensibility/lack of limits should be stated.<code></code></h1>
<p><code></code>
<code></code>
The routine should be used to:<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>Show the first twenty primes.<code></code></li>
<li>Show the primes between 100 and 150.<code></code></li>
<li>Show the <code>number</code> of primes between 7,700 and 8,000.<code></code></li>
<li>Show the 10,000th prime.<code></code>
<code></code>
<br><code></code>
Show output on this page.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code>Note:</code> You may reference code already on this site if it is written to be imported/included, then only the code necessary for import and the performance of this task need be shown. (It is also important to leave a forward link on the referenced tasks entry so that later editors know that the code is used for multiple tasks).<code></code>
<code></code>
<code>Note 2:</code> If a languages in-built prime generator is extensible or is guaranteed to generate primes up to a system limit, (2<sup>31</sup> or memory overflow for example), then this may be used as long as an explanation of the limits of the prime generator is also given. (Which may include a link to/excerpt from, language documentation).<code></code>

<br>nice site to check results:<code></code>
Website with vast count of primes. Small ones for the first 10000 and up to 1,000,000,000,000 aka 1E12, divided in subranges : "Each compressed file contains 10 million primes" <br><code></code>
