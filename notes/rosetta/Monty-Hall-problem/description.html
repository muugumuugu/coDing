<code></code>
Suppose you're on a game show and you're given the choice of three doors.<code></code>
<code></code>
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.<code></code>
<code></code>
The car and the goats were placed randomly behind the doors before the show.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Rules of the game:<code></code>
After you have chosen a door, the door remains closed for the time being.<code></code>
<code></code>
The game show host, Monty Hall, who knows what is behind the doors, now has to open one of the two remaining doors, and the door he opens must have a goat behind it.<code></code>
<code></code>
If both remaining doors have goats behind them, he chooses one randomly.<code></code>
<code></code>
After Monty Hall opens a door with a goat, he will ask you to decide whether you want to stay with your first choice or to switch to the last remaining door.<code></code>
<code></code>
Imagine that you chose Door 1 and the host opens Door 3, which has a goat.<code></code>
<code></code>
He then asks you "Do you want to switch to Door Number 2?"<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>The question:<code></code>
Is it to your advantage to change your choice?<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Note:<code></code>
The player may initially choose any of the three doors (not just Door 1), that the host opens a different door revealing a goat (not necessarily Door 3), and that he gives the player a second choice between the two remaining unopened doors.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Task:<code></code>
Run random simulations of the <a href="wp:Monty_Hall_problem|Monty Hall">wp:Monty<em>Hall</em>problem|Monty Hall</a> game. Show the effects of a strategy of the contestant always keeping his first guess so it can be contrasted with the strategy of the contestant always switching his guess.<code></code>
<code></code>
Simulate at least a thousand games using three doors for each strategy <u>and show the results</u> in such a way as to make it easy to compare the effects of each strategy.<code></code>
