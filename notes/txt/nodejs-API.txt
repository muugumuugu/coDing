Building API in Node:
    why??
        some silly files require a server.
            LARGE FILES if theres a lot of files to churn by the client(sayp5 sketch), then its better to use a server 
            PERSISTENCE also if there's user data entry and that which requires persistant data, then we need a server.
            API sharing my data with other users , so that they can query it etc.
            CORSproxyETc-webscraping client is not allowed to reach to another server and request data. so server pulls the data and passes it to client
POST request: sends data to server for storing /processing etc.
