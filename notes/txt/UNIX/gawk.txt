| IGNORECASE  | Controls the case-sensitivity of all regular expression and string operations. If IGNORECASE has a non-zero value, then string comparisons and pattern matching in rules, field splitting with FS, record separating with RS, regular expression matching with ~ and !~, and the gensub(), gsub(), index(), match(), split(), and sub() built-in functions all ignore case when doing regular expression operations. NOTE: Array subscripting is not affected. However, the asort() and asorti() functions are affected                                                                                                                                  |

| asort(s [, d])          | Returns the number of elements in the source array s. The contents of s are sorted using gawk's normal rules for comparing values, and the indexes of the sorted values of s are replaced with sequential integers starting with 1. If the optional destination array d is specified, then s is first duplicated into d, and then d is sorted, leaving the indexes of the source array s unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| asorti(s [, d])         | Returns the number of elements in the source array s. The behavior is the same as that of asort(), except that the array indices are used for sorting, not the array values. When done, the array is indexed numerically, and the values are those of the original indices. The original values are lost; thus provide a second array if you wish to preserve the original.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| h [, t])                | regular expression r. If h is a string beginning with g or G, then replace all matches of r with s. Otherwise, h is a number indicating which match of r to replace. If t is not supplied, $0 is used instead. Within the replacement text s, the sequence \n, where n is a digit from 1 to 9, may be used to indicate just the text that matched the n'th parenthesized subexpression. The sequence 0 represents the entire matched text, as does the character &. Unlike sub() and gsub(), the modified string is returned as the result of the function, and the original target string is not changed.                 |
| gsub(r, s [, t])        | For each substring matching the regular expression r in the string t, substitute the string s, and return the number of substitutions. If t is not supplied, use $0. An & in the replacement text is replaced with the text that was actually matched. Use & to get a literal &.

| index(s, t)             | Returns the index of the string t in the string s, or 0 if t is not present. (This implies that characterindices start at one.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| length([s])             | Returns the length of the string s, or the length of $0 if s is not supplied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| match(s, r [, a])       | Returns the position in s where the regular expression r occurs, or 0 if r is not present, and sets the values of RSTART and RLENGTH. Note that the argument order is the same as for the ~ operator: str ~ re. If array a is provided, a is cleared and then elements 1 through n are filled with the portions of s that match the corresponding parenthesized subexpression in r. The 0'th element of a contains the portion of s matched by the entire regular expression r. Subscripts a[n, "start"], and a[n, "length"] provide the starting index in the string and length respectively, of each matching substring. |
| split(s, a [, r])       | Splits the string s into the array a on the regular expression r, and returns the number of fields. If r is omitted, FS is used instead. The array a is cleared first. Splitting behaves identically to field splitting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| sprintf(fmt, expr-list) | Prints expr-list according to fmt, and returns the resulting string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| strtonum(str)           | Examines str, and returns its numeric value. If str begins with a leading 0, strtonum() assumes that str is an octal number. If str begins with a leading 0x or 0X, strtonum() assumes that str is a hexadecimal number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| sub(r, s [, t])         | Just like gsub(), but only the first matching substring is replaced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| substr(s, i [, n])      | Returns the at most n-character substring of s starting at i. If n is omitted, the rest of s is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| tolower(str)            | Returns a copy of the string str, with all the upper-case characters in str translated to their corresponding lower-case counterparts.

| mktime(datespec) | Turns datespec into a time stamp of the same form as returned by systime(). The datespec is a string of the form YYYY MM DD HH MM SS[ DST]. The contents of the string are six or seven numbers representing respectively the full year including century, the month from 1 to 12, the day of the month from 1 to 31, the hour of the day from 0 to 23, the minute from 0 to 59, and the second from 0 to 60, and an optional daylight saving flag. The values of these numbers need not be within the ranges specified; for example, an hour of -1 means 1 hour before midnight. The origin-zero Gregorian calendar is assumed, with year 0 preceding year 1 and year -1 preceding year 0. The time is assumed to be in the local timezone. If the daylight saving flag is positive, the time is assumed to be daylight saving time; if zero, the time is assumed to be standard time; and if negative (the default), mktime() attempts to determine whether daylight saving time is in effect for the specified time. If datespec does not contain enough elements or if the resulting time is out of range, mktime() returns -1. |

| [, timestamp]])  | specification in format. The timestamp should be of the same form as returned by systime(). If timestamp is missing, the current time of day is used.If format is missing, a default format equivalent to the output of date(1) is used. See the specification for the strftime() function in ANSI C for the format conversions that are guaranteed to be available. A public-domain version of strftime(3) and a man page for it come with gawk; if that version was used to build gawk, then all of the conversions described in that man page are available to gawk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| systime()        | Returns the current time of day as the number of seconds since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC on POSIX systems).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
