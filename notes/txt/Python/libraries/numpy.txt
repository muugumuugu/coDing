====== numpy ======
Created Friday 15 October 2021

NumPy is a package that defines a multi-dimensional array object and associated fast math functions that operate on it.  It also provides simple routines for linear algebra and fft and sophisticated random-number generation.  NumPy replaces both Numeric and Numarray.  http://www.scipy.org and http://www.numpy.org/

A very complete manual by the principal author of Numpy, Travis Oliphant, is [[http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/nlp/Software/NumPyBook.pdf|available]] for free (although donations are accepted). Note that the online documentation via docstring is rather complete and not stripped in any way. Further documentation is available from http://docs.scipy.org/doc/

Many examples of numpy usage can be found at http://wiki.scipy.org/Numpy_Example_List

{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
from numpy import *

from PIL import Image


ar = ones((100,100),float32)

ar = ar * 100

for i in range(0,100):
	ar[i,:] = 100 + (i * 1.5)

im = Image.fromarray(ar,"F")
