====== Python ======
Created Friday 15 October 2021

* space sensitice language
* auto typesetting of variables
* importing libraries:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
#import library as an object with attributes and methods
import module_name
# fills name space
from module_name import constant1,function1
}}}

* comments
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
# single line
'''
multi-line
'''

}}}

* variables are passed by value.
	* variables not bins but bindings, and each new value change just switches the binding.
	* unbinded contaitners are periodically cleaned (garbage collection)
	* check type using ''isinstance'' function
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"

var1="test var" # variable declared as it is initialized
id(var1)#returns memory address of variable
str1="11"
int1=int(str1,2) # converst string to integer in given base'
#here int1 = 3

}}}
