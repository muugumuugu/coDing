Title: Lorentz 3D Chaos
Description: Graphical representation of the Lorentz Chaos Differential equations.This program lets you play with the Lorentz differential equations so that you can experience that a minute change in de starting values can cause unpredictable changes in the endresult. Because the figure is 3-dimensional, you can rotate the figure in space.These equations lay at the basis of 'the butterfly hypothesis'.Have fun!!!
