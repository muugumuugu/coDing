Title: Advanced Calculation Solver 1.2
Description: The basic function of this program takes an inputted mathematical string (e.g.: "ln e + rnd(2) + 3(2)4 * (log(tan (itan 1)))"), evaluates it, and returns the result. Its features are listed below:<ul type=disc><li>Mathematical string evaluation using a compiler theory</li><li>Flexible language</li><li>Radian and degree modes</li><li>Decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal modes</li><li>Editable logarithm bases</li><li>Editable number of decimal places</li><li>Fully customizable appearance and behavior</li></ul>The program also has support for several special math items that are listed below:<ul type=disc><li>User-defined constants</li><li>Graphing of equations (both x = ? and y = ?)</li><li>Graphing in radian or degree mode</li><li>Graphing in normal or derivative mode</li><li>User-defined graphing window size (minimum X/Y, maximum X/Y, scale X/Y)</li><li>Statistical analysis from a list</li><li>Box-and-whisker plots</li></ul>Full documentation is included with Advanced Calculation Solver, which includes feature descriptions, how to use the program, syntax descriptions, and detailed explanations of the workings of the code.<p>Bug fixes:<ul type=disc><li>Derivative bug that, when in radian mode, gave an incorrect graph display</li><li>Parsing bug that parsed from right to left instead of left to right</li></ul>Anton Venema<br>avenema@nc.rr.com<p>Please remember to vote!<p>
