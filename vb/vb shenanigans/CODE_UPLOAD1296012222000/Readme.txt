Have fun with my proggie.
About me:
I have been programming since I was 8 about 10 years ago.  I started programming I a TRS-80 or more commonly known as a TRASH-80, I know thats old even ten years ago, but I didn't have a whole lot of money.  And the newest computers being the Pentium as most of you know theres not a whole lot of difference in speed or quality (cough).  The only other thing besides a pentium that was better that the TRS-80 in that time was everything.  So I programmed for 3 years in tandy basic.  Then upgrading to a home built 8086 I started using GW-Basic and not long after found that my friend had QBasic on his 386 and since he had a color monitor you can imagine I spent alot of time at his house (this is about 1994).  In 1996 we moved from our Washintion residence into Oregon when my dad got a job at Intel.  We made money, my dad sold stock and then I had access to a Pentium 120 with 32megs of memory and 4megs of VRAM...wow!  Ok, ok, this was 5 years ago.  But my dad bought Visual Basic 4.0 which I wrote the insect simulator in (or RSISS sounds more...profesional, hehe).  I have since inhereted my brother in laws learning edition of Visual C++ 5.0 and am currently learning.
