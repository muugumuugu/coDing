Title: 3D Mathematical Plot
Description: This project shows how to take any custom equation that is a function of X and Y, and plot it in a picture box. The plot is a rudimentary 2D colored contour plot, but it does look pretty. This project has several useful components:
1) An equation parser class with built-in error checking
2) Color mixing algorithms with a customized interface
3) Shows how to plot XYZ values in a picture box
Cool stuff...
