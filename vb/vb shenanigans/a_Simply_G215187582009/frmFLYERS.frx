ÿiNEURAL NET TRAINED BY 
GENETIC ALGORITHM

A Population of Individuals moves 
according to a Population of Neural Nets. 
The Goal is to stay closer to the Red 
Point. Before changing red point (start) 
position the population is evaluated.
The nearest reproduce and replace the 
worst. (This is performed by GA.)
Neural Nets are Updated by putting to 
Neuron Biases and Sinapses Weights the 
Genes of GA.
Net Inputs are 3: How much red point is 
LeftRight, how much it is FrontBack and 
the distance from it.
Net Outputs are 2: Steer and 
Accellerate/brake.
[Good Results after 150-200 Generations]
