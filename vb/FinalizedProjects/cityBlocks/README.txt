 REQUIREMENTS
==============

 This game is built using the following specifications hence these things are
 also recommended.

 - WindowsXP Professional (so graphic mode switching is quick and reliable)
 - DirectX 8
 - Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.7 (ADO 2.7)
 - Microsoft Jet and Replication Objects 2.6
 - Windows Media Player 9 Series (version 7+ "should" also do the work, I think!)
 - 128 MB RAM 
 - AGP Card (so drawing is fast and supports full-screen mode. see full-screen info)
 - In case of Windowed Mode: 800x600 or 1024x768 screen resolution are best
 - Fonts: Verdana, Webdings, Courier New, MS Sans Serif

=======================
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=======================

* Full-Screen Mode

 The full-screen mode actually switches the current graphic mode into 640x480 resoultion.
 That is because the graphics used in this game were from Transport Tycoon Deulux which
 is a DOS-based game and runs at the same 640x480 screen size.

 WARNING! 
 Your operating system may ask you to restart your windows when you play the full-screen
 mode. This happens when your OS is not sure whether 640x480 resolution is supported or
 not. You can restart your windows but then you will have to run the game again. Anyways,
 restarting again and again will be too much painful, so better play the Window mode if
 this problem happens. But do try this thing and restart windows for the first time. If
 Windows asks you to restart everytime you run the game, better stick to Windowed mode.

 TIP:
 Just to be on the safe side, set your screen resolution to 640x480 (by default WindowsXP
 doesnt show this screen size in the Display Properties. If that is the case, then leave
 this tip.) before running the game. If Windows asks you to restart then restart windows.
 If it doesn't then no problem. After restarting (or not restarting if not required), set
 your screen resolution back to normal again and then run the game. The thing which we
 just did right here allows Windows to check whether this resolution is supported or not.
 If it is supported, windows notes it downs and doesn't ask for restart again.


* Sounds

  Sound Effects can be turned on/off from About window.


* Music

 You have the Music folder. You can put whatever you want (YES! EVEN VIDEOS!) in that
 folder.. but make sure whatever you put in that folder is playable by Windows Media
 Player. And if you add music files to the Music folder while the game is playing, you
 will have to restart the game to be able to play those files.
