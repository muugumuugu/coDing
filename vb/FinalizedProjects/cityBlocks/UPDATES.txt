 - Added a really cool special effect!! Now when you hover your mouse selection
   over a building, it turns to blue color. It helps a lot when there is a congestion
   between your building placements and you cant see on which building your mouse
   is currently on.

 - The ability to save and load maps. Only one map can be saved at the moment. This
   procedure is based on MS Access database, so you can open you database and modify
   the bank balance in it :D :D

 - Improved the framerate. Now the game doesnt render the graphics which are not currently
   visible ie. on the screen. Same with sound. Sounds from buildings that are not
   visible will not be heard; overall improving performance.

 - The game now starts from 1st January, 2005. Earlier it used to start from the
   real current date.


 - Another lovely building added called Modern Offices.

 - Parks are now charged for maintanence every month. Unlike other buildings which give
   monthly taxes, parks are require monthly expenses.

 - Sound Effects can be switched off from the About window.


 - Minor fixes include a minor increase in frame rate and a little fix with Tall Office
   Block.

---------------------------------

 - New buildings added!! 3 parks, 1 house (Flats), and 1 office (Office Complex). Some
   buildings were renamed and some construction and destroying amounts were also adjusted.

 - Now you can build roads and complete your metropolis! A variety of road joint types
   are available to allow you to build all possible connections.

 - Keyboard shortcuts added:

   * ESC		Closes all windows and returns the mouse into normal state.
   * Arrow Keys		Move around the terrain

 - Sounds added, which require DirectX 8. Sounds are original from Transport Tycoon Duluxe.

 - Some icons and mouse pointers were fixed.

 - A major flaw was found and fixed in the terrain geometry. The tiles were not accurately
   placed. They were overlapping and my whole code is now built on that flaw.
   And just because of that stupid problem my coding is so long. If I had found out that
   problem, my code would have been significantly less than this; frame rate would have
   been better and I would have been able to add much more things to the game.. like 
   airplanes, vehicles, etc. I cant add them now, because I will have to rebuild the whole
   game on the basis of new geometry sizes.. which is a very long work! However I have
   been able to add the roads.. but you and I both know the road arent well programmed :\

 - Few other glitches were fixed.

 - Toolbar is replaced with my custom toolbar which helps me in button grouping. Its based
   on the new LineButton control.

 - LineButton control was just a small little pathetic control. I've added the features of
   Image, FlatButton, and Selected which makes this into a professional looking modern control.

 - More animation frames added to exploded tile. Grass doesn't appear all of a sudden,
   now it 'grows'.

 - Now you can explode an already exploded area and go on exploding like mad! Fire in the hole!


 - Added new mouse cursors when the terrain is scrolled through right-click.

 - Fixed the problem with mouse selection tile (the white tile that appears when the user is
   about to build, destroy or get info about some tile). Previously the tile didnt appear over
   constructed areas, but only grass tiles. Now it appears on all tiles whether constructed
   or destroyed tiles.
