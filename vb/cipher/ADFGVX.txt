The ADFGVX cipher was the most important German Field cipher, used during World War I. It combines the fractioning of a Polybius Square with a single Columnar Transposition. Although this combination provided a powerfull encryption, Georges Painvin, a brilliant Frensh codebreaker, succeeded in breaking the German cipher. The letters ADFGVX were chosen because they were well distinguist in morse code.

The ADFGVX Cipher requires two keys. One for the square and one for a single columnar transposition.

Message     : THIS IS A SECRET
Square key  : CALIFORNIA
Columnar key: APOLLO

To use the ADFGVX cipher, we start with a matrix with 6 rows and columns. This matrix is filled with the alphabet and the numbers 0 to 9. We skip the double letters and add the numbers directly after his corresponding letter, 1 after A, 2 After B and so on, with 0 as last number after J.

The key, completed with the rest of the alphabet:

Square Key: CALIFORNBDEGHJKMPQSTUVWXYZ

The numbers inserted:

Square Key: C3A1LI9F6ORNB2D4E5G7H8J0KMPQSTUVWXYZ
 

 | A D F G V X
-+------------
A| C 3 A 1 L I
D| 9 F 6 O R N
F| B 2 D 4 E 5
G| G 7 H 8 J 0
V| K M P Q S T
X| U V W X Y Z

We read of the square code by reading the row and the column of the letter.

Message    : T  H  I  S  I  S  A  S  E  C  R  E  T
Square code: VX GF AX VV AX VV AF VV FV AA DV FV VX

Next, we perform a single columnar transposition on the Square code:

A P O L L O
1 6 4 2 3 5
-----------
V X G F A X
V V A X V V
A F V V F V
A A D V F V
V X

Finally, we read off by the columns in the key order and write down the cipher text in groups:

Cipher text: VVAAV FXVVA VFFGA VDXVV VXVFA X

To decipher the message we begin with the columnar transposition and continue with the square to finally retrieve the plain text.
