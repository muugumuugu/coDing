# Rosetta Code Examples for P5
![Rosetta Code Examples for P5 Logo 300x300](logo/rosetta_examples_p5-logo-300x300.png)

Examples from [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/)
for [Processing](http://processing.org) (Java Mode)
and [Python Mode for Processing](https://py.processing.org/)
and [Processing.R](https://processing-r.github.io/).


These sets of example Processing sketches (includiing Java mode, Python mode,
and R mode) compile available versions of code tasks listed on the Rosetta Code
wiki. The examples are directly downloadable from the repository. They may
also be loaded directly into the Processing PDE desktop environment through
Contributions Manager under the Examples tab.

> Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present
> solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to
> demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person
> with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.

Rosetta Code has ~1000 tasks including file and sysem access, string
manipulation, math problems, graphics output and more -- with some of these
tasks implemented in dozens or even hundreds of programming languages (although
the example sketches here only the Processing implementations).

A few examples include:

-  Anagrams
-  Archimedean spiral
-  Binary digits
-  Draw a pixel
-  FizzBuzz
-  Josephus Problem
-  Levenshtein distance
-  Mandelbrot set
-  Ninety-nine bottles
-  Rename a file
-  Sieve of Eratosthenes

Simply put, this project both solicits Processing contributions to Rosetta Code
and curates the resulting examples as a set for Processing language learners.


## Getting the examples

Examples are available from the github project homepage:
https://github.com/jeremydouglass/rosetta_examples_p5

You may download the files as a zip or clone the repository using the
"Clone or Download" button.

Another option is to install all the examples through the desktop Processing
Development Environment (PDE). From the menu, File > Examples > Add Examples
will open the Contributions Manager to the Examples tab. Download the example
set. All sketches will be installed in the Examples subfolder of your
Processing data folder, and available through the Examples pop-up menu under 
Contributed Examples > Rosetta Examples for P5.

Examples are organized in subfolders by mode / language: Java, Python, and R.
