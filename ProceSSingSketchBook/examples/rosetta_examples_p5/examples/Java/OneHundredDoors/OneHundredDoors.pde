 * 
 * There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
 * You make 100 passes by the doors.
 * 
 * The first time through, visit every door and  toggle  the door 
 * (if the door is closed,  open it;   if it is open,  close it).
 * The second time, only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, ...),
 * and toggle it.
 * The third time, visit every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, ...),
 * etc, until you only visit the 100th door.
 * 
 * Task:
 * 
 * Answer the question:
 * What state are the doors in after the last pass?
 * Which are open, which are closed?
