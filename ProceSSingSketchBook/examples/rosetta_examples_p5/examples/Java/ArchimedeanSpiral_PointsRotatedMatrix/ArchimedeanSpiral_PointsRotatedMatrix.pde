 * 
 * The Archimedean spiral is a spiral named after the Greek mathematician
 * Archimedes. An Archimedean spiral can be described by the equation:
 * 
 *   r = a + bÎ¸
 * 
 * with real numbers a and b.
 * 
 * Task:
 * 
 * Draw an Archimedean spiral.

// Rotates the canvas matrix using the built-in rotate() and draws a simple
// point, rather than computing rotated coordinates with sin()/cos().
// 
// When drawn with points the rotation must be very small, and initially the
// animation is very slow. This is because the points will move further and
// further apart as the radius increases.
