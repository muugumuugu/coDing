Draw a clock

Task:

Draw a clock.

More specific:

Draw a time keeping device. It can be a stopwatch, hourglass, sundial, a
mouth counting "one thousand and one", anything. Only showing the seconds is
required, e.g.: a watch with just a second hand will suffice. However, it
must clearly change every second, and the change must cycle every so often
(one minute, 30 seconds, etc.) It must be drawn; printing a string of
numbers to your terminal doesn't qualify. Both text-based and graphical
drawing are OK.
 
The clock is unlikely to be used to control space flights, so it needs not
be hyper-accurate, but it should be usable, meaning if one can read the
seconds off the clock, it must agree with the system clock.
A clock is rarely (never?) a major application: don't be a CPU hog and poll
the system timer every microsecond, use a proper timer/signal/event from your
system or language instead. For a bad example, many OpenGL programs update
the frame-buffer in a busy loop even if no redraw is needed, which is very
undesirable for this task.
 
A clock is rarely (never?) a major application: try to keep your code simple
and to the point. Don't write something too elaborate or convoluted, instead
do whatever is natural, concise and clear in your language.

Key points
-  animate simple object
-  timed event
-  polling system resources
-  code clarity

# This simple example of an analog wall clock uses the Processing built-in
# time functions second(), minute(), and hour(). For each hand it rotates the
# sketch canvas and then draws a straight line.
