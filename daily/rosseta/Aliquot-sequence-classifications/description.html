<p>An <a href="wp:Aliquot sequence|aliquot sequence">wp:Aliquot sequence|aliquot sequence</a> of a positive integer K is defined recursively as the first member<code></code>
being K and subsequent members being the sum of the <a href="Proper divisors">Proper divisors</a> of the previous term.<code></code>
<code></code>
:* If the terms eventually reach 0 then the series for K is said to <code>terminate</code>.<code></code>
<code></code>
:<br>There are several classifications for non termination:<code></code>
:* If the second term is K then all future terms are also K and so the sequence repeats from the first term with period 1 and K is called <code>perfect</code>.<code></code>
:* If the third term <code>would</code> be repeating K then the sequence repeats with period 2 and K is called <code>amicable</code>.<code></code>
:* If the N<sup>th</sup> term <code>would</code> be repeating K for the first time, with N &gt; 3 then the sequence repeats with period N - 1 and K is called <code>sociable</code>.<code></code>
:<br>Perfect, amicable and sociable numbers eventually repeat the original number K; there are other repetitions...<code></code>
:* Some K have a sequence that eventually forms a periodic repetition of period 1 but of a number other than K, for example 95 which forms the sequence <code>95, 25, 6, 6, 6, ...</code> such K are called <code>aspiring</code>.<code></code>
:* K that have a sequence that eventually forms a periodic repetition of period &gt;= 2 but of a number other than K, for example 562 which forms the sequence <code>562, 284, 220, 284, 220, ...</code> such K are called <code>cyclic</code>.<code></code>
<code></code>
:<br>And finally:<code></code>
:* Some K form aliquot sequences that are not known to be either terminating or periodic; these K are to be called <code>non-terminating<code>'. <br>For the purposes of this task, K is to be classed as non-terminating if it has not been otherwise classed after generating '</code>16</code> terms or if any term of the sequence is greater than 2**47 = 140,737,488,355,328.<code></code>
