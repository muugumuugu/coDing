<p>Number base conversion is when you express a stored integer in an integer base, such as in octal (base 8) or binary (base 2). It also is involved when you take a string representing a number in a given base and convert it to the stored integer form. Normally, a stored integer is in binary, but that's typically invisible to the user, who normally enters or sees stored integers as decimal.<code></code>

<br>Task:<code></code>
Write a function (or identify the built-in function) which is passed a non-negative integer to convert, and another integer representing the base.<code></code>
<code></code>
It should return a string containing the digits of the resulting number, without leading zeros except for the number &nbsp; <code>0</code> &nbsp; itself.<code></code>
<code></code>
For the digits beyond 9, one should use the lowercase English alphabet, where the digit &nbsp; <code>a<code>' = 9+1, &nbsp; '</code>b</code> = a+1, &nbsp; etc.<code></code>
<code></code>
For example: &nbsp; the decimal number &nbsp; <code>26<code>' &nbsp; expressed in base &nbsp; '16' &nbsp; would be &nbsp; '</code>1a</code>.<code></code>
<code></code>
Write a second function which is passed a string and an integer base, and it returns an integer representing that string interpreted in that base.<code></code>
<code></code>
The programs may be limited by the word size or other such constraint of a given language. There is no need to do error checking for negatives, bases less than 2, or inappropriate digits.<code></code>
