<p>A <a href="Truncatable primes|truncatable prime">Truncatable primes|truncatable prime</a> is one where all non-empty substrings that finish at the end of the number (right-substrings) are also primes <code>when understood as numbers in a particular base</code>. The largest such prime in a given (integer) base is therefore computable, provided the base is larger than 2.<code></code>

Let's consider what happens in base 10. Obviously the right most digit must be prime, so in base 10 candidates are 2,3,5,7. Putting a digit in the range 1 to base-1 in front of each candidate must result in a prime. So 2 and 5, like the whale and the petunias in <code>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</code>, come into existence only to be extinguished before they have time to realize it, because 2 and 5 preceded by any digit in the range 1 to base-1 is not prime. Some numbers formed by preceding 3 or 7 by a digit in the range 1 to base-1 are prime. So 13,17,23,37,43,47,53,67,73,83,97 are candidates. Again, putting a digit in the range 1 to base-1 in front of each candidate must be a prime. Repeating until there are no larger candidates finds the largest left truncatable prime.<code></code>

Let's work base 3 by hand:<code></code>
<code></code>
0 and 1 are not prime so the last digit must be 2. 12<sub>3</sub> = 5<sub>10</sub> which is prime, 22<sub>3</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub> which is not so 12<sub>3</sub> is the only candidate. 112<sub>3</sub> = 14<sub>10</sub> which is not prime, 212<sub>3</sub> = 23<sub>10</sub> which is, so 212<sub>3</sub> is the only candidate. 1212<sub>3</sub> = 50<sub>10</sub> which is not prime, 2212<sub>3</sub> = 77<sub>10</sub> which also is not prime. So there are no more candidates, therefore 23 is the largest left truncatable prime in base 3.<code></code>

The task is to reconstruct as much, and possibly more, of the table in <a href="https://oeis.org/A103443 the OEIS">https://oeis.org/A103443 the OEIS</a> as you are able.<code></code>
