It can be a stopwatch, hourglass, sundial, a mouth counting "one thousand and one", anything. Only showing the seconds is required, e.g.: a watch with just a second hand will suffice. However, it must clearly change every second, and the change must cycle every so often (one minute, 30 seconds, etc.) It must be <code>drawn</code>; printing a string of numbers to your terminal doesn't qualify. Both text-based and graphical drawing are OK.<code></code></h1>
<h1 id="theclockisunlikelytobeusedtocontrolspaceflightssoitneedsnotbehyperaccuratebutitshouldbeusablemeaningifonecanreadthesecondsofftheclockitmustagreewiththesystemclockc6c">The clock is unlikely to be used to control space flights, so it needs not be hyper-accurate, but it should be usable, meaning if one can read the seconds off the clock, it must agree with the system clock.<code></code></h1>

For a bad example, many OpenGL programs update the frame-buffer in a busy loop even if no redraw is needed, which is very undesirable for this task.<code></code></h1>

Don't write something too elaborate or convoluted, instead do whatever is natural, concise and clear in your language.<code></code></h1>
