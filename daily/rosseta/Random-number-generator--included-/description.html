<p>The task is to:<code></code>
: State the type of random number generator algorithm used in a language's built-in random number generator. If the language or its immediate libraries don't provide a random number generator, skip this task.<code></code>
: If possible, give a link to a wider <a href="wp:List of random number generators|explanation">wp:List of random number generators|explanation</a> of the algorithm used.<code></code>
<code></code>
<small>Note: the task is <code>not</code> to create an RNG, but to report on the languages in-built RNG that would be the most likely RNG used.</small><code></code>

The main types of pseudo-random number generator (<a href="wp:PRNG|PRNG]]) that are in use are the <a href="[linear congruential generator|Linear Congruential Generator]] ([[wp:Linear congruential generator|LCG]]), and the Generalized Feedback Shift Register ([[wp:Generalised_feedback_shift_register#Non-binary_Galois_LFSR|GFSR]]), (of which the [[wp:Mersenne twister|Mersenne twister]] generator is a subclass). The last main type is where the output of one of the previous ones (typically a Mersenne twister) is fed through a [[cryptographic hash function">wp:PRNG|PRNG]]) that are in use are the [[linear congruential generator|Linear Congruential Generator]] ([[wp:Linear congruential generator|LCG]]), and the Generalized Feedback Shift Register ([[wp:Generalised<em>feedback</em>shift<em>register#Non-binary</em>Galois<em>LFSR|GFSR]]), (of which the [[wp:Mersenne twister|Mersenne twister]">[linear congruential generator|Linear Congruential Generator]] ([[wp:Linear congruential generator|LCG]]), and the Generalized Feedback Shift Register ([[wp:Generalised</em>feedback<em>shift</em>register#Non-binary<em>Galois</em>LFSR|GFSR]]), (of which the [[wp:Mersenne twister|Mersenne twister]] generator is a subclass).

Note that neither LCGs nor GFSRs should be used for the most demanding applications (cryptography) without additional steps.<code></code></p>
