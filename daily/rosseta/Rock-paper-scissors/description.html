<p><br>Task:<code></code>
Implement the classic children's game <a href="wp:Rock-paper-scissors|Rock-paper-scissors">wp:Rock-paper-scissors|Rock-paper-scissors</a>, as well as a simple predictive &nbsp; <code>AI</code> &nbsp; (<u>a</u>rtificial <u>i</u>ntelligence) &nbsp; player.<code></code>
<code></code>
Rock Paper Scissors is a two player game.<code></code>
<code></code>
Each player chooses one of rock, paper or scissors, without knowing the other player's choice.<code></code>
<code></code>
The winner is decided by a set of rules:<code></code>
<code></code>
:::* &nbsp; Rock beats scissors<code></code>
:::* &nbsp; Scissors beat paper<code></code>
:::* &nbsp; Paper beats rock<code></code>
<code></code>
<br><code></code>
If both players choose the same thing, there is no winner for that round.<code></code>
<code></code>
For this task, the computer will be one of the players.<code></code>
<code></code>
The operator will select Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer will keep a record of the choice frequency, and use that information to make a <a href="Probabilistic choice|weighted random choice">Probabilistic choice|weighted random choice</a> in an attempt to defeat its opponent.<code></code>
