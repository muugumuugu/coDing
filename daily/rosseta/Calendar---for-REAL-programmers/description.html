<p><br>Task:<code></code>
Provide an algorithm as per the <a href="Calendar">Calendar</a> task, except the entire code for the algorithm must be presented &nbsp; <code>entirely without lowercase</code>.<code></code>
<code></code>
Also - as per many 1969 era <a href="wp:line printer#Paper (forms) handling|line printer">wp:line printer#Paper (forms) handling|line printer</a>s - format the calendar to nicely fill a page that is 132 characters wide.<code></code>
<code></code>
(Hint: manually convert the code from the <a href="Calendar">Calendar</a> task to all UPPERCASE)<code></code>
<code></code>
This task also is inspired by <a href="http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/realmen.html Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL">http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/realmen.html Real Programmers Don't Use PASCAL</a> by Ed Post, Datamation, volume 29 number 7, July 1983.<code></code>
 THE REAL PROGRAMMER'S NATURAL HABITAT<code></code>
 "Taped to the wall is a line-printer Snoopy calender for the year 1969."<code></code>
<code></code>
Moreover this task is further inspired by the <code>long lost</code> corollary article titled:<code></code>
 "Real programmers think in UPPERCASE"!<code></code>

For economy of size, do not actually include Snoopy generation<code></code>

<code>Trivia:</code> The terms uppercase and lowercase date back to the early days of the mechanical printing press.  Individual metal alloy casts of each needed letter, or punctuation symbol, were meticulously added to a press block, by hand, before rolling out copies of a page. These metal casts were stored and organized in wooden cases. The more often needed <code>minuscule letters were placed closer to hand, in the lower cases of the work bench.  The less often needed, capitalized, majuscule</code> letters, ended up in the harder to reach upper cases.<code></code>
