<p>Soundex is an algorithm for creating indices for words based on their pronunciation.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Task:<code></code>
The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling &nbsp; (from the &nbsp; <a href="wp:soundex|soundex &nbsp; Wikipedia article">wp:soundex|soundex &nbsp; Wikipedia article</a>).<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Caution:<code></code>
There is a major issue in many of the implementations concerning the separation of two consonants that have the same soundex code! According to the official Rules <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html">https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html</a>. So check for instance if <code>Ashcraft<code>'  is coded to '</code>A-261</code>.<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>If a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) separates two consonants that have the same soundex code, the consonant to the right of the vowel is coded. Tymczak is coded as T-522 (T, 5 for the M, 2 for the C, Z ignored (see "Side-by-Side" rule above), 2 for the K). Since the vowel "A" separates the Z and K, the K is coded.<code></code></li>
<li>If "H" or "W" separate two consonants that have the same soundex code, the consonant to the right of the vowel is not coded. Example: Ashcraft is coded A-261 (A, 2 for the S, C ignored, 6 for the R, 1 for the F). It is not coded A-226.<code></code>
