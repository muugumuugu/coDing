It is said that all types derived from some base type T and the type T itself form a class T.<code></code>
<code></code>
The first type T from the class T sometimes is called the <code>root type</code> of the class.<code></code>
<code></code>
A class of types itself, as a type, has the values and operations of its own.<code></code>
The operations of are usually called <code>methods</code> of the root type.<code></code>
Both operations and values are called <a href="polymorphism | polymorphic">polymorphism | polymorphic</a>.<code></code>
<code></code>
A polymorphic operation (method) selects an implementation depending on the actual specific type of the polymorphic argument.<code></code>
<code></code>
The action of choice the type-specific implementation of a polymorphic operation is called <code>dispatch<code>'. Correspondingly, polymorphic operations are often called 'dispatching' or '</code>virtual</code>.<code></code>
Operations with multiple arguments and/or the results of the class are called <code>multi-methods</code>.<code></code>
A further generalization of is the operation with arguments and/or results from different classes.<code></code>
<code></code></p>
<ul>
<li>single-dispatch languages are those that allow only one argument or result to control the dispatch. Usually it is the first parameter, often hidden, so that a prefix notation <code>x.f() is used instead of mathematical f(x</code>).<code></code></li>
<li>multiple-dispatch languages allow many arguments and/or results to control the dispatch.<code></code>
<code></code>
<br><code></code>
A polymorphic value has a type tag indicating its specific type from the class and the corresponding specific value of that type.<code></code>
This type is sometimes called <code>the most specific type</code> of a <a href="polymorphic">polymorphic</a> value.<code></code>
The type tag of the value is used in order to resolve the dispatch.<code></code>
The set of polymorphic values of a class is a transitive closure of the sets of values of all types from that class.<code></code>
<code></code>
In many <a href="object-oriented programming | OO">object-oriented programming | OO</a> languages<code></code>
the type of the class of T and T itself are considered equivalent.<code></code>
In some languages they are distinct (like in <a href="Ada">Ada</a>).<code></code>
When class T and T are equivalent, there is no way to distinguish<code></code>
polymorphic and specific values.<code></code>
<code></code>

Create a basic class with a method, a constructor, an instance variable and how to instantiate it.<code></code>
