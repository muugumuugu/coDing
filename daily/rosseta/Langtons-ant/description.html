<p><a href="wp:Langton's ant|Langton's ant">wp:Langton's ant|Langton's ant</a> is a cellular automaton that models an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant ant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant ant</a> sitting on a plane of cells, all of which are white initially, the ant facing in one of four directions.<code></code>
<code></code>
Each cell can either be black or white.<code></code>
<code></code>
The ant moves according to the color of the cell it is currently sitting in, with the following rules:<code></code>
::# &nbsp; If the cell is black, it changes to white and the ant turns left;<code></code>
::# &nbsp; If the cell is white, it changes to black and the ant turns right;<code></code>
::# &nbsp; The ant then moves forward to the next cell, and repeat from step 1.<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>This rather simple ruleset leads to an initially chaotic movement pattern, and after about 10000 steps, a cycle appears where the ant moves steadily away from the starting location in a diagonal corridor about 10 cells wide.<code></code>
Conceptually the ant can then walk infinitely far away.<code></code>
<code></code>
<code></code>
<br>Task:<code></code>
Start the ant near the center of a 100<small>x</small>100 field of cells, which is about big enough to contain the initial chaotic part of the movement.<code></code>
<code></code>
Follow the movement rules for the ant, terminate when it moves out of the region, and show the cell colors it leaves behind.<code></code>
