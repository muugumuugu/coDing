<p>The checkpoint synchronization is a problem of synchronizing multiple <a href="task]]s. Consider a workshop where several workers (<a href="[task]]s) assembly details of some mechanism. When each of them completes his work they put the details together. There is no store, so a worker who finished its part first must wait for others before starting another one. Putting details together is the <code>checkpoint at which [[task">task]]s. Consider a workshop where several workers ([[task]">[task]]s) assembly details of some mechanism.

Let two [[task</a>s A and B need to be synchronized at a checkpoint. Each signals its event (<code>EA and EB correspondingly), then waits for the AND-combination of the events (EA&amp;EB) and resets its event. Consider the following scenario: A signals EA first and gets blocked waiting for EA&amp;EB. Then B signals EB and loses the processor. Then A is released (both events are signaled) and resets EA. Now if B returns and enters waiting for EA&amp;EB</code>, it gets lost.<code></code>

When a worker is ready it shall not continue before others finish. A typical implementation bug is when a worker is counted twice within one working cycle causing its premature completion. This happens when the quickest worker serves its cycle two times while the laziest one is lagging behind.<code></code>

If you can, implement workers joining and leaving.<code></code></p>
